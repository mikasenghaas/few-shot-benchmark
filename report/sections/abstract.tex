    Learning from few samples remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially in biomedical tasks were data availability is often a limiting factor. 
    Our study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of prominent few-shot learning algorithms, including Baseline, Matching Networks, Prototypical Networks and MAML, 
    applied to two biomedical tasks adapted for few-shot learning: single-cell type prediction using the Tabula Muris dataset and protein function prediction using the 
    \nobreak{SwissProt} dataset. Our results demonstrate the robustness of these algorithms in learning effective representations even from limited biomedical data. 
    % No longer applies, wait till the new experiments are done
    % Notably, employing the transductive SOT feature transform combined with meta-learners emerged as a highly effective approach, facilitating precise knowledge transfer.
