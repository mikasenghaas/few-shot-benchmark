    Learning from few samples remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially in biomedical tasks were data availability is often a limiting factor. Our study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of prominent few-shot learning algorithms, as cited in~\cite{baseline, matchingnet, protonet, maml} applied to two biomedical tasks  adapted for few-shot learning: single-cell type prediction using the Tabula Muris dataset~\cite{tabula2018} and protein function prediction with SwissProt data~\cite{uniprot2019}.
    The results demonstrate the robustness of these algorithms in learning effective representations even from limited data. Notably, employing the transductive SOT~\cite{sot} feature transform combined with meta-learners emerged as a highly effective approach, facilitating rapid and precise knowledge transfer.
