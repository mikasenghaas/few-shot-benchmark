\section{Conclusion}

In summary, we demonstrate the effectiveness of both transfer and meta-learning algorithm for learning effective feature representations for classification tasks with limited data in the biomedical domain. 
Notably, employing the transductive SOT feature transform combined with meta-learners emerged as a highly effective approach, facilitating rapid and precise knowledge transfer even in the most challenging few-shot learning settings with many classes and only a single example per class. Especially the interaction with a subsequent embedding module that mixes information between the support and query set proved to be a crucial component for the success of the transductive SOT feature transform.
