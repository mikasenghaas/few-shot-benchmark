\section{Conclusion}

In summary, we demonstrate the effectiveness of both transfer and meta-learning algorithm for learning effective feature representations for classification tasks with limited data in the biomedical domain. 
Notably, employing the transductive SOT feature transform combined with meta-learners emerged as a viable approach, especially Matching Networks' performance improved with minimal computational overhead. However, as some methods show decreased performance after the inclusion of SOT, the adaption of the module should be treated like a hyper-parameter tuned to the specific task at hand.
