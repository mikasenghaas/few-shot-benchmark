\section{Conclusion}

In summary, we demonstrate the effectiveness of both transfer and meta-learning algorithms for learning effective feature representations for classification tasks with limited data in the biomedical domain. 
Notably, employing the transductive SOT feature transform combined emerged as an effective approach, consistently improving performance across models, datasets and few-shot settings. Extensive hyperparameter tuning is crucial to achieve optimal performance.
