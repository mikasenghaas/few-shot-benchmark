\subsection{Experiment 1: General Benchmark}

Table \ref{tab:tuned-benchmark} and Figure \ref{fig:benchmark-perf} present the test accuracy of various methods in a 5-way, 5-shot setting for two datasets. In this setting, methods without the SOT module achieve an average accuracy of 87\% on the \texttt{TM} dataset and 66\% on the \texttt{SP} dataset, providing a strong baseline performance.

Moreover, the inclusion of the SOT module improves the performance of all methods, except for the Baseline. The \texttt{B++} method shows only a slight enhancement with SOT. In contrast, the other three methods benefit significantly from SOT, with an average performance increase of 12\% for \texttt{TM} and 48\% for \texttt{SP}. This indicates a considerable effect size from integrating the SOT module in both datasets.

\subsection{Experiment 2: Way-Shot Analysis}

Figure \ref{fig:way-shot} illustrates the results of the way-shot analysis, displaying test accuracy in relation to the number of classes (left subplot) and the number of samples (right subplot).

Predictably, in the absence of the \texttt{SOT} module, accuracy diminishes as the number of ways increases and rises with more shots. Conversely, with the \texttt{SOT} module, accuracy remains consistent across varying numbers of ways and shots.

\subsection{Experiment 3: SOT integration}

In Figure \ref{fig:sot-interaction-scatter}, we illustrate the performance of various 
configurations of the \texttt{MatchingNet} method with and without the \texttt{SOT} 
module. Firstly, it is evident that without any form of embedding, regardless of the presence or 
absence of the \texttt{SOT} module, the performance is only 40\%. Secondly, in the absence of the 
\texttt{SOT} module, the optimal performance is achieved through the embedding of support vectors. 
Slightly inferior performance is observed when the query vectors are embedded. 
Most notably, the \texttt{SOT} module enhances the performance of all configurations. 
However, the optimal performance is attained in configurations where at least one of the 
support or query vectors is embedded.
