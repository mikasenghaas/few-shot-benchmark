\section{Results}

% -------- Part 1: Benchmark
\input{tables/tuned-benchmark.tex}
Table \ref{tab:tuned-benchmark} displays the results of the first part of 
our benchmark study. We fine-tuned hyper-parameters of each method on the given dataset and 
then evaluated it across 600 episodes. The table presents the mean accuracy,
 accompanied by a 95\% confidence interval across the episodes. 
 The \texttt{Diff} column indicates the change in mean accuracy when we 
 introduce the \texttt{SOT} module to the method.

Firstly, we observe that for the 5-way, 5-shot setting, all methods without 
\texttt{SOT} already reach an average accuracy of 87\% for the \texttt{TM} 
dataset and 66\% for the \texttt{SP} dataset, establishing a very solid baseline performance.
Secondly, we notice that the presence of the \texttt{SOT} module enhances all 
methods except for the Baseline. However, for \texttt{B++}, the performance improvement is only marginal. 
In contrast, for the remaining three methods, \texttt{SOT} improved the performance for the \texttt{TM} dataset 
by an average of 12\% and by 48\% for the \texttt{SP} dataset. 
Therefore, for both datasets, we observe a substantial effect size after the integration of the \texttt{SOT} module.

\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:way-shot} shows the relationship between the number of ways and shots
and the accuracy of the \texttt{ProtoNet} method on \texttt{TM} dataset. 
As we would expect, without the \texttt{SOT} module, the accuracy decreases with the number of ways and 
increases with the number of shots. However, with the \texttt{SOT} module, the accuracy remains 
stable across different ways and shots. 

% -------- Part 3: SOT integration into the matching net

    \label{fig:sot-interaction-scatter}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:sot-interaction-scatter}, we illustrate the performance of various 
configurations of the \texttt{MatchingNet} method with and without the \texttt{SOT} 
module. Firstly, it is evident that without any form of embedding, regardless of the presence or 
absence of the \texttt{SOT} module, the performance is only 40\%. Secondly, in the absence of the 
\texttt{SOT} module, the optimal performance is achieved through the embedding of support vectors. 
Slightly inferior performance is observed when the query vectors are embedded. 
Most notably, the \texttt{SOT} module enhances the performance of all configurations. 
However, the optimal performance is attained in configurations where at least one of the 
support or query vectors is embedded.
